# Project Description
    This project is about an hexagonal maze solver. It is an application that allows users to solve the mazes they create themselves. I started with the algorithmic part, in which I applied Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph between two nodes. Then I switched to work on the GUI of my application. I started by designing a GUI model with Adobe Photoshop ("tp04/InterfaceGraphiqueModel01") to reach, as well as a logo for my application ("tp04/logoGUI"). In the next parts of this README file I am going to specify fils to execute and to explain how it generally works.

## Document usage and functionality
To run the graphic application, you should run the MainApp.java file ("\tp04\src\graphicInterface\MainApp.java").
In the menu bar, you will find "?" item which will lead you to "help". I tried to explain how to handle the application.

1. Run the MainApp.java file, the application will display;
2. To configure your maze, there is two ways :
   ## the first is to import it from a text file 
    To do so, you should click on File menu item at the top, and then you will find "import from file" button. A choice dialog window will be displayed, and will allow you to select your file.
    The file must contain a valid maze,
