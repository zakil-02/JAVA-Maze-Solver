# Project Description
    This project is about an hexagonal maze solver. It is an application that allows users to solve the mazes they create themselves. I started with the algorithmic part, in which I applied Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph between two nodes. Then I switched to work on the GUI of my application. I started by designing a GUI model with Adobe Photoshop ("tp04/InterfaceGraphiqueModel01") to reach, as well as a logo for my application ("tp04/logoGUI"). In the next parts of this README file I am going to specify fils to execute and to explain how it generally works.

## Document usage and functionality
To run the graphic application, you should run the MainApp.java file ("\tp04\src\graphicInterface\MainApp.java").
